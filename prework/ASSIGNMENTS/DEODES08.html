		<p>To start designing pages in HTML, you must consider that HTML consists of two basic parts: the head and the body. Both of them use pieces of code called tags. Tags define the styles for text, link files, insert graphics and create different forms.
		
		<P>Tags are classified also as independents and dependents. The independent tags may be used by themselves, like the &ltp&gt tag that ends a paragraph. Other tags must be used together. For example to style a first level heading it is required an opening and closing tag &lth1&gt, and &lt/h1&gt. All closing tags contain a slash. Tags for linking files and creating forms require additional parts (also called arguments) to work properly.
