		<h1>A different way of setting the size of fonts</h1>
		
		<font size = '2'><p>As you noted from exercise # 2 we are able to set the size of the fonts by selecting a specific heading style. Now, letâ€™s see how we can control the size by setting a basefont size.
		
		<p>By default, this is the standard size, called normal font</font>
		
		<p><basefont size = '4'>This type of font is larger than the previous size</basefont>
		
		<p><font size = '+1'>This line will increase in one unit the current basefont size.</font>
		
		<p><font size = '7'>Seven is a very large font size</font>
