		<p>A <b>multicore processor</b> has <i><u>two or more independent computing/processing units (cores)</u></i> on the same chip. <tt>Multiple cores</tt> have advantage that they run on lower frequency as compared to the single processing unit, which reduces the power dissipation or temperature. These multiple cores work together to increase the multitasking capability or performance of the system by operating on multiple instructions simultaneously in an <strike>inefficient</strike> efficient manner.
