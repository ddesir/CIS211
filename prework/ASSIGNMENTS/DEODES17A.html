		<h1>Links to Parts of the Same Document</h1>
		
		<p>Text and graphics can link to places within the same document. These links require two parts; the anchor and the link. The anchor identifies the place to jump to. The link uses the name of the anchor instead of the name of a file.
		
		<p>For example: clicking on the word <b>Buffer</b> in the list below will scroll the window to the place where the anchor is. You will find a definition of Buffer. When the document is very long you can jump around quickly. OL means ordered (numbered) list
		
		<ol>
			<li><a href = '#ATM'>ATM</a></li>
			<li><a href = '#Buffer'>Buffer</a></li>
			<li><a href = '#Backbone'>Backbone</a></li>
			<li><a href = '#Centrex'>Centrex</a></li>
			<li><a href = '#Cellular'>Cellular Phone</a></li>
			<li><a href = '#Bridge'>Bridge</a></li>
		</ol>
