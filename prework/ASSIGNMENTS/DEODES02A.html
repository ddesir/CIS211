		<h1>The Central Processing Unit and Its Components</h1>
		
		<h2>The Central Processing Unit</h2>
		
		<p>The <em>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</em> is the unit which performs most of the processing in a computer.
		
		<p>The CPU is the heart or brain of the computer. It receives data input, executes instructions, and processes information.
		
		<h2>The Primary Components of the CPU</h2>
		
		<p>The CPU has two primary components, the <strong>ALU</strong>, or <em>Arithmetic Logic Unit</em> and the <strong>CU</strong>, or <em>Control Unit</em>. The CU extracts instructions from the memory, decodes and executes them. The ALU handles arithmetic and logic operations.
