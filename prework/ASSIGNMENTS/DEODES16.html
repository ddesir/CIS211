		<h1>Alternatives for Non-graphical Browsers</h1>
		
		<p>In the past, some browsers didnâ€™t support 100% graphics, when users tried to see them on their screen, the only thing they saw was text. An expression like [IMAGE] replaces the graphic. You may be able to get them understand what kind of graphic you inserted.
		
		<p>This is achieved by using an extended version of the &lt;img&gt; tag. The &lt;alt&gt; tag allows you to include a description of the graphic. This descriptive copy substitutes for the graphic. It is a good idea to do this for all graphics.
		
		<p><a href = 'WLAN.html'><img src = 'wireless.jpg' alt = '[The Wireless LAN (WLAN) structure]' border = '2px #3C133B'></a><br />Click the picture to see a message "This is the definition of Wireless Local Area Network."
