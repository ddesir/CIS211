		<h1>Working with Terms and Definitions</h1>
		
		<p>In many cases we donâ€™t need to list items without numbers or bullets. They look like dictionaries where you mention something and then provide a definition. You may use tags to define the beginning of a list (&ltDL&gt); the beginning of each term (&ltdt&gt) and the terms definitions (&ltdd&gt)
