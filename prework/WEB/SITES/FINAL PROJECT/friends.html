				<h1>Friends</h1>
				
				<h2>My People</h2>
				
				<p>These are the people who anchor me and let me know that I'm in the right place, at the right time in life. They encourage me, they comfort me, they push me... They are my friends.</p>
				
				<div class = 'friend'>
					<img src = 'img/eva.jpg' class = 'profile-photo left' alt = 'Eva' />
				
					<h3>Eva</h3>
				
					<p>A friend in the truest sense, Eva is becoming a bigger and bigger player in my support system. She's a light to the people around her. One of the most nurturing people I've ever met.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class = 'friend'>
					<img src = 'img/joel.jpg' class = 'profile-photo left' alt = 'Joel' />
				
					<h3>Joel</h3>
				
					<p>Joel is the plug. Through him, I met the majority of the great people who've come into my life recently. He is also a true friend and will spare not effort to try to be there when needed.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class = 'friend'>
					<img src = 'img/jonathan.jpg' class = 'profile-photo left' alt = 'Jonathan' />
				
					<h3>Johnathan</h3>
				
					<p>One of my newest friends. He and I share some common interests and we just get along really well. One of the few people I can talk to for hours about nothing.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class = 'friend'>
					<img src = 'img/mori.jpg' class = 'profile-photo left' alt = 'Mori' />
				
					<h3>Mori</h3>
				
					<p>A class mate and a friend, Mori has become part of my support system this semester. I can count on her to give me a hard time just for the laugh and to know when I just need someone to talk to for a moment.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class = 'friend'>
					<img src = 'img/nick.jpg' class = 'profile-photo left' alt = 'Nick' />
				
					<h3>Nick</h3>
				
					<p>He calls me Pops (inside joke). One of the first people I connected with since being back at Medgar Evers. In a way, I'd consider him like family. One of the people who remind me why I do what I do.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class = 'friend'>
					<img src = 'img/njambi.jpg' class = 'profile-photo left' alt = 'Njambi' />
				
					<h3>Njambi</h3>
				
					<p>My original mental health guardian. She's always there to remind me that I am human and that it's OK. There have been a lot of changes in my life over the last couple of years and she's been there through all of them.</p>
				</div>
				
				<h2>What We Do</h2>
				
				<p>Being a full time employee and full time student doesn't leave much time for socializing. We're all doing things. When the semester's over... There will be more margin. </p>
