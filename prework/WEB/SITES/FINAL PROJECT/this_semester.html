				<h1>This Semester <button onclick = 'goBack ()' id = 'back'>&lt;</button></h1>
				
				<p>This semester, I learned HTML5, CSS3, and a little Javascript. While everything I learned, may not have been learned as part of the course material, I learned a lot. I learned enough to be confident enough to experiment while building out this site.
				
				<h2>Code and Languages</h2>
				
				<h3>HTML5</h3>
				
				<p>During the course of CIS 211, I learned basic HTML5 syntax and best practices. I learned how to build documents, validate my code and to use more semantically correct HTML.</p>
				
				<h3>CSS3</h3>
				
				<p>This semester, I also learned how to style my HTML with CSS. I used pseudo-classes, selectors, and CSS animations. While, at the time I'm tapping this out, I used flex box, I didn't not fully learn the concept. I am in a good place to take my knowledge further.</p>
				
				<h3>Javascript</h3>
				
				<p>For the first time, I explored some of the HTML Document Object Model with Javascript. I wanted to do some things that weren't possible with HTML and CSS alone, but I knew that some scripting could make those things happen. I wrote the date / time function before it was provided and tweaked it a bit afterwards.</p>
				
				<h2 id = 'little_more'>All My Own</h2>
				
				<p>To build this site, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Every "bit" was not crafted from scratch by me, but I did learn from what was there and I took it and made it all my own. Prior to this site, I may have seen CSS animations, and didn't know what they were. I have attempted to learn Javascript, but I've never learned or used it in the context of web development.</p>
				
				<p>I set out to learn as much as possible and make everything I present in these pages my own. I used <a href = 'cs211_final_maps.html' title = 'Jupyter Notebook of custom maps'>Python to generate maps</a>, so that it would match my color scheme and highlight areas that I wanted, as in the case of the markers on the world map or the rivers on the rivers page.</p>
