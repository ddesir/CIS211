		<h1>SUBSCRIPTS AND SUPERSCRIPTS</h1>
		
		<p>When writing expressions in algebra very frequently we need use<br />
		the symbol of power for example in an equation like this
		
		<h1>AX<sup>2</sup>=16P<sup>3</sup>C<sup>4</sup></h1>
		
		<p>In this case we may say that the variables X, P and C are exposed in the<br />
		second, third and fourth powers.
		
		<p>Also in chemistry we express the chemical reactions by using<br />
		indexation techniques:
		
		<p>Water is represented as
		
		<h1>H<sub>2</sub>0</h1>
