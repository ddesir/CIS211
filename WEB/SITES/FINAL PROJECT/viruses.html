				<h3>The Difference Between Viruses and Worms</h3>
				
				<p><b>Viruses</b> have to be be executed on the host computer in order to activate. <b>Worms</b> don't need a host and can be spread and self replicate on the internet and networks.
				
				<ol id = 'rank'>
					<li>The Morris Worm &ndash; In 1988, the worm was released by its author. It was the first malicious to get wide media attention. Within 24 hours of its release, an estimated 10 percent of computers connected to the internet were affected. The malware slowed down thousands of systems by creating files in temporary folders in an effort to replicate itself. PCs were rendered useless within 90 minutes of infection.</li>
					
					<li>Melissa Virus &ndash; The Concept virus was instead spread, accidentally, by professional firms. Microsoft itself was partly responsible when it shipped Windows 95 Software Compatability Test CD-ROMs containing the virus. But Concept acted as a forerunner to the Melissa virus. A Word file was uploaded to the Usenet discussion group, alt.sex in March 1999. This contained a list of passwords for 80 porn websites, so you can imagine how many downloaded it. Once they did so, it automatically forwarded onto the first 50 contacts in the Microsoft Outlook address book. The virus was inspired by an episode of the Simpsons and named for a stripper its author met in Miami.</li>

					<li>ILOVEYOU &ndash; Took a similar approach to the Melissa virus, yet was far more devastating. It was a worm spread via an email with the subject line “ILOVEYOU”. It came with the attachment, “LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.txt.vbs”. Once opened, it would send itself to everyone in the Outlook address book, making this one of the fastest-spreading viruses at the time. Far more troubling was its capacity to overwrite files. If you didn’t have back-ups (and comparatively few personal networks did), you would have to kiss goodbye to your JPEGs and audio files. Further file types that were overwritten include CSS, HTA, and JSE.</li>
					
					<li>MyDoom &ndash; This exceeded the impact of ILOVEYOU and has yet to be surpassed. Fingers crossed it never will be. Because MyDoom and variations of it have caused an estimated $38.5 billion in damages worldwide. The worm acts on a similar principle as ILOVEYOU: an email—with misleading subjects like “Mail Delivery System”—includes an attachment which, once opened, sends itself to addresses found in local files. Whereas previous worms targeted a limited number of contacts, MyDoom wasn’t picky.</li>
					
					<li>WannaCry &ndash; Cast your minds back to May 2017 and you’ll recall a lot of panic about WannaCry. There was fair reason for it. Despite only lasting a few days, the ransomware spread across between 200,000 and 300,000 computers worldwide. Once infected, a computer’s screen locks, showing a red warning and two countdowns, one until the ransom demand would rise and the other until files would be permanently deleted.</li>
