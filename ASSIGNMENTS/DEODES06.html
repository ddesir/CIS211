		<h1>Difference between BR, P and NoBR</h1>
		
		<p>Whenever we need to break a line or end a paragraph in a specific place, we insert a tag. If you donâ€™t include a tag, the text will automatically flow to fit the width of the browser window, and break differently when the browser window is resized.
		
		<p>There are plenty of other good reasons to break<br />
		lines<br />
		and<br />
		paragraphs.
		
		<p>It is recommended to break large copy blocks into smaller segments to increase readability.
		
		<p><nobr>The no break tag prevents text and graphics from reflowing to fit the browser window. It is a paired tag. If you want to indicate a place to break text within non-breaking sections, use word break tag. Place this tag within the no break tags.</nobr>
