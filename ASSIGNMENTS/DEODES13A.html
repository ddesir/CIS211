		<p>Tape backup was the primary method for backup during the 60s and 70s. It has grown and evolved with businesses for more than four decades. Tapes are a cheap alternative to other storage methods. Reading and writing from tapes take longer, there is a higher chance of data corruption than some other methods.
		
		<p>Cloud-based or online backup usually refers to off-site backup to a third party service provider or own cloud infrastructure via cloud enablement and / or on-site appliances.
