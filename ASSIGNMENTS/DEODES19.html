		<h1>Line Splitters or Dividing Rules</h1>
		
		<hr />
		
		<p>It is convenient to present pages divided by topics. The &lt;hr&gt;tag inserts a rule completely across the screen. The rule will break the page wherever inserted. It will appear black and scale width as the browser window.
		
		<hr />
		
		<p>Another way to divide documents into sections is by using graphics as rules. You make the graphic rule in a paint program and insert it with the &lt;img&gt;tag. Graphic rules do not change width when the browser screen is resized. The rule will not break the copy unless you use the &lt;p&gt; or &lt;br&gt; tags.
		
		<p>Other ways to control rules are by <br />
		width and alignment
		
		<hr align = 'left' width = '200'>
		<hr align = 'center' width = '200'>
		<hr align = 'right' width = '200'>
		<hr align = 'center' width = '80%'>
		
		<p>size
		
		<hr size = '10'>
		
		<p>and shading
		
		<hr size = '10' noshade>
