		<h1>A wireless LAN (or WLAN, for wireless local area network, sometimes referred to as LAWN, for local area wireless network) is one in which a mobile user can connect to a local area network (LAN ) through a wireless (radio) connection.</h1>
		
		<h3>The IEEE 802.11 group of standards specify the technology for wireless LANs. 802.11 standards use the ethernet protocol and CSMA/CA (carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance) for path sharing and include an encryption method, the Wired Equivalent Privacy algorithm.</h3>
