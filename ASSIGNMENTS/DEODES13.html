		<h1>DIMENSIONS FOR GRAPHICS</h1>
		
		<p>One problem of Web design is load time. LowSRC can help by substituting a low resolution graphic while the text loads. Another way to speed up load time is by including Width and Height dimensions as part of the IMG tag.
		
		<p>Width and height dimensions tell the browser how large an image will be before it retrieves the graphic file. The browser first blocks out the required space, lays out the document, displays the text and then loads the graphic.
		
		<p>Scaling graphics is another use of the width and height arguments. Browsers will stretch or squeeze graphics to fit the size you define. Width and Height are measured in pixels.

		<img src = 'thesad_zoo.jpg' width = '50' height = '50'>Regular
		<img src = 'thesad_zoo.jpg' width = '200' height = '75'>Large
