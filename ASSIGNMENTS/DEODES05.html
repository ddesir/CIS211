		<p>A very dark text is also called a <b>Bold</b> text. For this purpose we use the Bold tag.
		
		<p>To emphasize the meaning of a word, we use the <u>Underline</u> tag.
		
		<p>A special effect is created by <blink>Blinking</blink> tag. It works in Netscape only.
		
		<p>To differentiate a text (word) from others, the <i>Italic</i> helps a lot.
		
		<p>The special style called <tt>Typewritten</tt> is similar to the one produced by a typing manual machine.
		
		<p>The <s>Struck out</s> font is mostly used to show corrections in a text.
		
		<p>A text moving horizontally from right to left, looks like a <marquee>Slide</marquee> dynamically changing different positions on the screen.
