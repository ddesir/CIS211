		You are able to set up the preferences of files while publishing them. Regularly, the background is white or gray. Changes may be introduced by adding an HTML line specifying the path for the file of the background you select to change the default.
		
		<p>Background graphics are image files that are repeated like tiles filling the screen no matter how big or small the window. Remember large files mean long load times. Often backgrounds are texture rather than full color images. Or, if not textures, they are small simple graphics used to form a wallpaper pattern behind the text.
		
		<p>You set the background graphic in the &lt;body&gt; tag at the beginning of an HTML file. If you don't, the background will be a solid color. The review for this exercise will help you to insert a black background to this page.
