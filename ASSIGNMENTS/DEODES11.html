		<h1>Background, text and link colors</h1>
		
		<p>You set background, text and link colors in the body tag at the beginning of an HTML file. Color is a mix of red, green and blue by percent. Setting the bgcolor="102030" means 10% red, 20% green and 70% blue. Black is 000000, or no color. White is FFFFFF, or full color. Experiment finding combinations you like. Another way is by setting the basefont size or the font size.
