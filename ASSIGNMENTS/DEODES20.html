		<h1>Graphics in HTML</h1>
		
		<p>Browsers display graphic images along with text making documents look better. More importantly, images communicate information that would be impossible in words. Something to be considered is the time it takes to load images whenever a page is opening. Don’t overcrowd your design with images that you probably don’t need. Remember that the users want to get information as quick as possible.
